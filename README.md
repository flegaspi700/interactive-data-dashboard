This is my personal project for learning web development and exploring modern technologies. It's a work in progress as I continue to build my skills in creating interactive web applications.

This is my personal project for learning web development and exploring modern technologies. It's a work in progress as I continue to build my skills in creating interactive web applications.

### What I'm Building



An interactive dashboard that displays real-time information from various sources:

### What I'm Building

- Weather updates with current conditions and forecasts

- Latest technology news headlines  

- GitHub user activity and repository statsAn interactive dashboard that displays real-time information from various sources:

- Cryptocurrency price tracking

- Daily inspirational quotes

- Drag & drop widget reordering

- Weather updates with current conditions and forecasts## What This Project RepresentsA modern, customizable dashboard built with React 19 + TypeScript + Vite, featuring real-time data from multiple APIs with drag-and-drop widget reordering.This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Features include automatic data updates, dark/light theme switching, and responsive design for all devices.

- Latest technology news headlines  

### Technologies I'm Learning

- GitHub user activity and repository stats

- **React** - Building interactive user interfaces with modern hooks

- **TypeScript** - Adding type safety and better code organization- Cryptocurrency price tracking

- **API Integration** - Working with external data sources and handling async operations

- **Responsive Design** - Creating layouts that work across different screen sizes- Daily inspirational quotesThis dashboard is my hands-on exploration into modern web development. As someone passionate about learning new technologies, I decided to dive deep into React, TypeScript, and modern web APIs to create something both functional and visually appealing.

- **State Management** - Managing application state and data flow

- **Build Tools** - Using Vite for development and production builds- Drag & drop widget reordering



### Current Progress



‚úÖ Basic dashboard layout and structure  Features include automatic data updates, dark/light theme switching, and responsive design for all devices.

‚úÖ Widget system with reusable components  

‚úÖ API integrations for all data sources  ### Technologies I'm Learning

‚úÖ Theme switching functionality  

‚úÖ Drag and drop widget reordering  

‚úÖ Responsive design implementation  

üîÑ Ongoing: Code optimization and feature refinements- **React** - Building interactive user interfaces with modern hooks



### Next Steps in My Learning Journey- **TypeScript** - Adding type safety and better code organizationI created an interactive dashboard that brings together different types of information in one place:![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-19.1.1-blue)



#### Short Term Goals (Next Few Weeks)- **API Integration** - Working with external data sources and handling async operations

- Add unit tests to practice testing methodologies

- Implement error boundaries for better error handling- **Responsive Design** - Creating layouts that work across different screen sizes

- Create widget customization features (let users change cities, categories, etc.)

- Explore adding more visual feedback and animations- **State Management** - Managing application state and data flow



#### Medium Term Goals (Next Few Months)- **Build Tools** - Using Vite for development and production builds- üå§Ô∏è **Weather updates** - See current conditions and forecasts![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-5.8.3-blue)- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh

- Learn backend development to build my own APIs

- Add user authentication system

- Build database integration for saving user preferences

- Create additional widgets (Calendar, Todo List, RSS feeds)### Current Progress- üì∞ **Latest tech news** - Stay updated with what's happening in technology  

- Experiment with widget resize functionality



#### Long Term Learning Path

- Dive deeper into backend technologies (Node.js, Python, or similar)‚úÖ Basic dashboard layout and structure  - üêô **GitHub activity** - Track coding progress and repositories![Vite](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vite-7.1.7-purple)- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- Explore mobile app development with React Native

- Study advanced architectural patterns‚úÖ Widget system with reusable components  

- Learn about deployment strategies and DevOps basics

- Consider contributing to open-source projects‚úÖ API integrations for all data sources  - üí∞ **Cryptocurrency prices** - Monitor digital currency trends
