## Interactive Dashboard - Learning Project


This is my personal project for learning web development and exploring modern technologies. It's a work in progress as I continue to build my skills in creating interactive web applications.



### What I'm Building


An interactive dashboard that displays real-time information from various sources:



- Weather updates with current conditions and forecasts## What This Project RepresentsA modern, customizable dashboard built with React 19 + TypeScript + Vite, featuring real-time data from multiple APIs with drag-and-drop widget reordering.This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

- Latest technology news headlines  

- GitHub user activity and repository stats

- Cryptocurrency price tracking

- Daily inspirational quotesThis dashboard is my hands-on exploration into modern web development. As someone passionate about learning new technologies, I decided to dive deep into React, TypeScript, and modern web APIs to create something both functional and visually appealing.

- Drag & drop widget reordering



Features include automatic data updates, dark/light theme switching, and responsive design for all devices.

### Technologies I'm Learning



- **React** - Building interactive user interfaces with modern hooks

- **TypeScript** - Adding type safety and better code organizationI created an interactive dashboard that brings together different types of information in one place:![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-19.1.1-blue)

- **API Integration** - Working with external data sources and handling async operations

- **Responsive Design** - Creating layouts that work across different screen sizes

- **State Management** - Managing application state and data flow

- **Build Tools** - Using Vite for development and production builds- 🌤️ **Weather updates** - See current conditions and forecasts![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-5.8.3-blue)- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
